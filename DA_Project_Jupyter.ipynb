Beamery is a tool that Kiwi.com uses for pre-sourcing candindates, for community events applications, and vistors. Jobvite, another HR tool, is used for tracking the applicants, e.g., people who actually applied for an open possition at Kiwi.com. All the data are focused on the engineering department. For GDPR purposes some scripts are not printed because the results contain name or email addresses. **Note that the data are not from the whole company, nor complete.**\n",
